These are programming exercises I do with my son. Quality of the code may vary as a result. We are building this for fun and education.

All code is licensed under the MIT license, and it may be used and redistributed in accordance with this license.

## Development
We use TypeScript for our projects. To set this up yourself I recommend using [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). To set up:

```bash
nvm i
npm install
```

To run the project locally:

```bash
npm run start
```
